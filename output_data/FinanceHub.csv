A measure for identifying a high-leverage point is leverage. If leverage is greater than 3 ( k + 1 _ n ) , where k is the number of independent variables, then the observation is potentially influential. A measure for identifying an outlier is studentized residuals. If the studentized residual is greater than the critical value of the t-statistic with n – k – 2 degrees of freedom, then the observation is potentially influential. Cook’s distance, or Cook’s D (Di), is a metric for identifying influential data points. It measures how much the estimated values of the regression change if observation i is deleted. If D i > 2 √ _ k / n , then it is highly likely to be influential. An influence plot visually presents leverage, studentized residuals, and Cook’s D for each observation. Dummy, or indicator, variables represent qualitative independent variables and take a value of 1 (for true) or 0 (for false) to indicate whether a specific condition applies, such as whether a company belongs to a certain industry sector. To capture n possible categories, the model must include n – 1 dummy variables. An intercept dummy adds to or reduces the original intercept if a specific condition is met. When the intercept dummy is 1, the regression line shifts up or down parallel to the base regression line. A slope dummy allows for a changing slope if a specific condition is met. When the slope dummy is 1, the slope changes to (dj + bj) × Xj, where dj is the coefficient on the dummy variable and bj is the slope of Xj in the original regression line. A logistic regression model is one with a qualitative (i.e., categorical) dependent variable, so logistic regression is often used in binary classification problems, which are common in machine learning and neural networks. To estimate a logistic regression, the logistic transformation of the event probability (P) into the log odds, ln[P/(1 − P)], is applied, which linearizes the relation between the transformed dependent variable and the independent variables. Logistic regression coefficients are typically estimated using the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method, and slope coefficients are interpreted as the change in the log odds that the event happens per unit change in the independent variable, holding all other independent variables constant.

REITs were initially conceived of as a way for small investors to gain exposure to a professionally managed, diversified real estate portfolio. REITs were viewed as a type of (closed-end) mutual fund and income passthrough vehicle through which the portfolio manager would acquire attractively valued properties, occasionally sell fully valued properties, and distribute property earnings to the trust’s investors. Legislation was passed in the United States in 1960 to authorize REITs, and the Netherlands followed suit in 1969. The US model and other types of tax-advantaged real estate investment vehicles have been adopted worldwide. The S&P 500 Index added REITs as a separate GICS sector in 2016. As of October 2020, more than 35 countries have REITs or REIT-like structures, more are considering adopting similar vehicles, and REITs are held by individuals and institutions alike.","The member should be able to: discuss types of publicly traded real estate securities justify the use of net asset value per share (NAVPS) in valuation of publicly traded real estate securities and estimate NAVPS based on forecasted cash net operating income describe the use of funds from operations (FFO) and adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) in REIT valuation calculate and interpret the value of a REIT share using the net asset value, relative value (price-to-FFO and price-to-AFFO), and discounted cash flow approaches explain advantages and disadvantages of investing in real estate through publicly traded securities compared to private vehicles","The principal types of publicly traded real estate securities include real estate investment trusts (REITs), real estate operating companies (REOCs), and residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities (RMBS and CMBS). Compared with other publicly traded shares, REITs typically offer higher-than-average yields and greater stability of income and returns. They are amenable to a net asset value approach to valuation because of the existence of active private markets for their real estate assets. Compared with REOCs, REITs offer higher yields and income tax exemptions but have less operating flexibility to invest in a broad range of real estate activities and less potential for growth from reinvesting their operating cash flows because of their high income-to-payout ratios. In assessing the investment merits of REITs, investors analyze the effects of trends in general economic activity, retail sales, job creation, population growth, and new supply and demand for specific types of space. Investors also pay particular attention to occupancies, leasing activity, rental rates, remaining lease terms, in-place rents compared with market rents, costs to maintain space and re-lease space, tenants’ financial health and tenant concentration in the portfolio, financial leverage, debt maturities and costs, and the quality of management and governance. Analysts make adjustments to the historical cost-based financial statements of REITs and REOCs to obtain better measures of current income and net worth. The three principal figures they calculate and use are (1) funds from operations or accounting net earnings, excluding depreciation, deferred tax charges, and gains or losses on sales of property and debt restructuring; (2) adjusted funds from operations, or funds from operations adjusted to remove straight-line rent and to provide for maintenance-type capital expenditures and leasing costs, including leasing agents’ commissions and tenants’ improvement allowances; and (3) net asset value or the difference between a real estate company’s asset and liability ranking prior to shareholders’ equity, all valued at market values instead of accounting book values. REITs and some REOCs generally return a significant portion of their income to their investors as required by law and, as a result, tend to pay high dividends. Thus, dividend discount or discounted cash flow models for valuation are also applicable. These valuation approaches are applied in the same manner as they are for shares in other industries. Usually, investors use two- or three-step dividend discount models with near-term, intermediate-term, and/or long-term growth assumptions. In discounted cash flow models, investors often use intermediate-term cash flow projections and a terminal value based on historical cash flow multiples.

The cost of debt is the after-tax cost to the issuer of debt, based on the return that debt investors require to finance a company. The cost of equity represents the return that equity investors require to own a company, also referred to as the required rate of return on equity or the required return on equity. A company’s WACC is used by the company’s internal decision makers to evaluate capital investments. For analysts and investors, it is a critical input used in company valuation. Equation (1) shows how a company’s WACC is driven by the proportions, or weights (the w i ), of the different capital sources used in its capital structure, applied to the costs of each source (the r i ): WACC = w d r d (1 – t) + w p r p + w e r e , where d , p , and e denote debt, preferred equity, and common equity, respectively. These weights are all non-negative and sum to 1.0. Determining a company’s WACC is an important, albeit challenging, task for an analyst given the following: Many different methods can be used to calculate the costs of each source of capital; there is no single, “right” method. Assumptions are needed regarding long-term target capital structure, which might or might not be the current capital structure. The company’s marginal tax rate must be estimated and might be different from its average or effective tax rate. Estimating the cost of capital for a company thus involves numerous, sometimes complex, assumptions and choices, all of which affect the resulting investment conclusion.","The member should be able to: explain top-down and bottom-up factors that impact the cost of capital, compare methods used to estimate the cost of debt, explain historical and forward-looking approaches to estimating an equity risk premium, compare methods used to estimate the required return on equity, estimate the cost of debt or required return on equity for a public company and a private company, and evaluate a company’s capital structure and cost of capital relative to peers.

Capital raised from sources other than public markets and traditional institutions and in the form of an equity investment is called private equity (PE). Similarly sourced capital extended to companies through a loan or other form of debt is referred to as private debt. Private capital relates to the entire capital structure, including PE and private debt. Private capital largely consists of private investment funds and entities that invest in the equity or debt securities of privately held companies, real estate, or other assets. Many private investment firms have PE and private debt arms; however, these teams typically refrain from investing in the same assets or businesses to avoid overexposure to a single investment and to avoid the conflict of interest that arises from being invested in both the equity and debt of an issuer. Private investment firms, even those with private debt arms, typically are referred to as PE firms. Although PE is the largest component of private capital, PE as a comprehensive generic category is inaccurate because other forms of private alternative finance have grown considerably in size and popularity.","The member should be able to: explain investment characteristics of private equity, explain investment characteristics of private debt, explain investment characteristics of real estate, explain investment characteristics of infrastructure, explain investment characteristics of natural resources, and explain investment characteristics of hedge funds.","Private capital is a broad term used for funding provided to companies sourced from neither the PE nor public debt markets. Capital provided in the form of equity investments is called PE, whereas capital provided as a loan or other form of debt is called private debt. PE refers to investment in privately owned companies or in public companies intended to be taken private. Key PE investment strategies include leveraged buyouts (e.g., management buyouts [MBOs] and management buy-ins [MBIs]) and venture capital. Primary exit strategies include trade sale, initial public offerings (IPO), and recapitalization. Private debt refers to various forms of debt provided by investors to private entities. Key private debt strategies include direct lending, mezzanine debt, and venture debt. Private debt also includes specialized strategies, such as collateralized loan obligation (CLOs), unitranche debt, real estate debt, and infrastructure debt.

https://cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level1a/RR_2024_L1V5R5_v1.pdf,Derivatives,2024,Level I,"Earlier lessons introduced forward commitment features, payoff profiles, and concepts used in pricing these derivative instruments. In particular, the relationship between spot and forward commitment prices was established as the opportunity cost of owning the underlying asset (represented by the risk-free rate) as well as any additional cost or benefit associated with holding the underlying asset. This price relationship both prevents arbitrage and allows a forward commitment to be replicated using spot market transactions and risk-free borrowing or lending. n the first lesson, we explore the pricing and valuation of forward commitments on a mark-to-market (MTM) basis from inception through maturity. This analysis is essential for issuers, investors, and financial intermediaries to assess the value of any asset or liability portfolio that includes these instruments. The second lesson addresses forward pricing for the special case of underlying assets with different maturities, such as interest rates, credit spreads, and volatility. The prices of these forward commitments across the so-called term structure are important building blocks for pricing swaps and related instruments in later lessons.","The member should be able to: explain how the value and price of a forward contract are determined at initiation, during the life of the contract, and at expiration; and explain how forward rates are determined for an underlying with a term structure and describe their uses.","A forward commitment price agreed upon at contract inception remains fixed and establishes the basis on which the underlying asset (or cash) will be exchanged in the future versus the spot price at maturity. For an underlying asset that does not generate cash flows, the value of a long forward commitment before expiration is equal to the current spot price of the underlying asset minus the present value of the forward price discounted at the risk-free rate. The reverse is true for a short forward commitment. Foreign exchange represents a special case in which the spot versus forward price is a function of the difference between risk-free rates across currencies. For an underlying asset with additional costs and benefits, the forward contract MTM value is adjusted by the sum of the present values of all additional cash flows through maturity. Underlying assets with a term structure, such as interest rates, have different rates or prices for different times-to-maturity. These zero or spot and forward rates are derived from coupon bonds and market reference rates and establish the building blocks of interest rate derivatives pricing. Implied forward rates represent a breakeven reinvestment rate linking short-dated and long-dated zero-coupon bonds over a specific period. A forward rate agreement (FRA) is a contract in which counterparties agree to apply a specific interest rate to a future period.

Forward commitments and contingent claims were distinguished by their different payoff profiles and other characteristics. We now turn our attention to the pricing and valuation of these instruments. As a first step, we explore how the price of a forward commitment is related to the spot price of an underlying asset in a way that does not allow for arbitrage opportunities. Specifically, the strategy of replication shows that identical payoffs to a forward commitment can be achieved from spot market transactions combined with borrowing or lending at the risk-free rate. Finally, the second lesson demonstrates how costs or benefits associated with owning an underlying asset affect the forward commitment price.","The member should be able to: explain how the concepts of arbitrage and replication are used in pricing derivatives, and explain the difference between the spot and expected future price of an underlying and the cost of carry associated with holding the underlying asset.","Forward commitments are an alternative means of taking a long or short position in an underlying asset. A link between forward prices and spot prices exists to prevent investors from taking advantage of arbitrage opportunities across cash and derivative instruments. A forward commitment may be replicated with a long or short spot position in the underlying asset and borrowing or lending at a risk-free rate. Investors can recreate a variety of positions by using appropriate combinations of spot, forward, and risk-free positions. The risk-free rate provides a fundamental link between spot and forward prices for underlying assets with no additional costs or benefits of ownership. The cost of carry is the net of the costs and benefits related to owning an underlying asset for a specific period and must be factored into the difference between the spot price and a forward price of a specific underlying asset. The cost of carry may include costs, such as storage and insurance for physical commodities, or benefits of ownership, such as dividends for stocks and interest for bonds. Foreign exchange represents a special case in which the cost of carry is the interest rate differential between two currencies. Forward prices may be greater than or less than the underlying spot price, depending on the specific cost of carry associated with owning the underlying asset.

In doing so, we contrasted the asymmetry of one-sided option payoffs with the linear or symmetric payoff of forwards and underlying assets. We now extend this analysis to show how to combine options to have an equivalent payoff to that of the underlying and a risk-free asset as well as a forward commitment. In the first lesson, we demonstrate that the value of a European call may be used to derive the value of a European put option with the same underlying details, and vice versa, under a no-arbitrage condition referred to as put–call parity. In the second lesson, we show how this may be extended to forward commitments and how the put–call parity relationship may be applied to option and other investment strategies. We will focus on European options on underlying assets with no income or benefit.","The member should be able to: explain put–call parity for European options, and explain put–call forward parity for European options.","Put–call parity establishes a relationship that allows the price of a call option to be derived from the price of a put option with the same underlying details and vice versa. Put–call parity holds for European options with the same exercise price and expiration date, representing a no-arbitrage relationship between put option, call option, underlying asset, and risk-free asset prices. If put–call parity does not hold, then riskless arbitrage profit opportunities may be available to investors. Put–call forward parity extends the put–call parity relationship to forward contracts given the equivalence of an underlying asset position and a long forward contract plus a risk-free bond. Under put–call forward parity, we may demonstrate that a purchased put option and a sold call option are equivalent to a long risk-free bond and short forward position, and a sold put and purchased call are equivalent to a long forward and short risk-free bond. Put–call parity may be applied beyond option-based strategies in finance—for example, to demonstrate that equityholders have a position equivalent to a purchased call option on the value of the firm with unlimited upside, while debtholders have a sold put option position on firm value with limited upside.
